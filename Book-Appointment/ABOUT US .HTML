        <li class="submedical">HealthCare is something everyone needs, it can be easy to forget that HealthCare is a service and patients are customers. But good customer service is just as important in medicine as it is in any other field, and because people's health is so important, bad medical care or shoddy customer service might cause clients to complain to local licensing boards or engage in other actions that can harm a medical business.

         <li class="subhour">   The Main Aim of this project is to provide a platform for Healthcare Providers such as hospitals to go online. Usually getting medicines from websites like Medcare or Netmeds is that they have multiple sellers thus customers have to stay in doubt whether the seller will be legitimate or not. Also it takes a lot of time for the ordered package to reach them. Using our services, Hospitals can cater to audience whom the audience can trust. </li>
